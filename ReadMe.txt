// Role function

As an admin, you can do the CRUD operation with the product in the stock

As an manager, you can do CRUD but you have another function which is inserting excel.
This excel will consist of the new arrival product

As a user, you can view the product and put them in the basket of order 

*** Please note that admin doesn't have duty to update new arrival product
    so I let it be the function of the manager.
*** only admin can do the CRUD operation on the productType
